Hi there! I'm Muhap Ayman, and I'm from Giza, Egypt. I'm really into data and how it tells us about our habits, feelings, and life lessons to help us improve.

I think understanding data can make a big difference in the world someday! I enjoy working with data, like cleaning it up, understanding it better, and making it easier to see through visuals.

I've also gone a step further by learning about using data to understand not just the past, but also the present and future, using things like machine learning and deep learning. It's amazing how machines can help us make sense of all this information!

Besides all that, I have plenty of other interests and hobbies, but I'll spare you the long list for now!

Skills: excel , power bi , python (Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib)
